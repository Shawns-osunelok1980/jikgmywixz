Oh man, I just 𝘸𝘢𝘵𝘤𝘩𝘦𝘥 Mountainhead and my brain is still spinning a bit. Like, is it even possible for a   to be that bonkers? Seriously, it was a wild ride from start to finish. It’s like they took every mountain cliche, threw it in a blender, and just hit “go.” Lol, you’d love it though, considering your taste in weird stuff. You HAVE to 𝘥𝘰𝘸𝘯𝘭𝘰𝘢𝘥 the   and let me know what you think.

I mean, the visuals were just insane. Those mountain shots? Totally breathtaking. Makes me wanna head to the hills and become a hermit or something. 😂 But then the plot twists! I swear, every ten minutes there was something that just had me going, “Wait, what did I just 𝘸𝘢𝘵𝘤𝘩?” It's like they didn’t even care to follow a normal storyline, which is kinda genius if you think about it.

> And don’t get me started on the characters, they were all over the place! I’m talking one moment they’re super serious, the next it’s like, who’s writing their dialogue, a cartoon hamster? But you know what, that's kinda the charm of it, right? Keeps you guessing, keeps you engaged. Or maybe I'm just easily amused, dunno.

Oh, oh, the soundtrack! Almost forgot to mention. Wasn’t expecting it to be that good. I might even 𝘥𝘰𝘸𝘯𝘭𝘰𝘢𝘥 a couple of tracks from it. Gotta say the music was the only thing that had any consistency throughout the whole two hours, lol. This is the kind of   where you’re just—𝘸𝘢𝘵𝘤𝘩 the   once and it gets stuck in your brain like an annoying earworm.

Speaking of which, how annoying was that one guy with the endless pep talks? Like, bro, no one asked for a TED Talk on top of a cliff. I was just yelling at the screen like “Dude, just climb or something, stop yapping!” 😂 Completely made up for it with that epic avalanche scene though, haha. 

for (int i = 0; i < 10; i++) { printf(𝘸𝘢𝘵𝘤𝘩_ out_for_avalanche!
); }

Anyway, can't rant forever. Let me know when you see it! We gotta discuss this crazy plot and see if I'm the only one feeling this kind of cinematic whiplash. Until then, catch ya later! 😜
